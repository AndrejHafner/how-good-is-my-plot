## How good is my plot? ##

Statistical plots are one of the basic tools, which a scientist can use to convey information. They are used and abused in many scientific works, and are unfortunately often not of a good quality. Therefore, the goal of our project is to develop a model that can find out what are the properties of a high-quality plot? The first thing that comes to mind is how well the plot presents the information in the data. 

Different types of plots are suitable for different kinds of data. A line plot is great for presenting time-series data, while it fails on categorical data. On the other hand, box plots can be great for categorical data, but inconvenient for continuous data. Since evaluating the quality of a plot on such a level requires a deeper understanding of the context, we focus mainly on the visual aspect. This enables us to utilize deep learning to find a relationship between the visual properties of the graph and its quality.
