# Urša Zrimšek's Data Science Project Competition journal

## February 2021 (3h 30min)

* 20\. (2h): Studied the article "What makes a good graph?" and tried to find how we could use it.
* 24\. (1h 30m): Discussion with team mates.

## March 2021 (1h 30min)

*3. (1h 30min): Had a meeting with teammates and mentors. Discussed about what we have found out and how to pursue 
further. Before the meeting I prepared the talking points and our questions.

## April 2021 (?)

*6. (2h): Studied options for plot type classification. Decided to use pytorch pretrained CNNs, which we can use for 
embeddings of the plot images, to then further classify them based on cosine distance or with SVM. If that won't work well, 
we can finetune the CNNs and classify directly with them.
*7. (2h): Made embeddings of images scraped from Google. I used ResNet101 trained on ImageNet.
